# Painting-APP
SPA, a kind of painter for children

The project based on Canvas technology, is written on Type Script with OOP-rules. 
I arranged an internal router in 2 variants: using Hashchange event or HTML5 History API (in this case it needs http-server-spa from npm).
I also use Webpack, Sass, Indexed DB technologies.
